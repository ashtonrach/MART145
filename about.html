<h2> The Basics of the Game</h2>
<p> Hockey is played on ice with two teams of 5 skaters, and each team has one goalie. Players use their sticks to control a rubber puck and try to score by shooting the puck past the other team's goalie into their net. </p>

<h3>Quick Facts</h3>
 <ul>
      <li>Games have three periods, 20 minutes each.</li>
      <li>Teams usually have six players on the ice (including the goalie).</li>
      <li>Checking and fast skating make hockey exciting to watch.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Why I Like Hockey</h2>
<p> I like the speed of the game and the energy that comes with it. There is almost always something happening, and the pace never slows down. It has taught me many important life lessons, and I have met some pretty cool people through the sport. It is one big community that is very tight.</p>
