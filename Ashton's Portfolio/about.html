<p>Hi, I’m Ashton Rach. This portfolio shows some of the projects I’ve worked on in MART 145. I kept everything simple, clean, and beginner-friendly. This course was so much fun! It really challenged me but also taught me some pretty cool things. As you can tell, I am a huge hockey fan. I am Canadian, so it makes sense. I learnt so many useful tools in this course that I am excited to use them in the real world.</p>
