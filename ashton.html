    <h2>Why Hockey Matters to Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hockey has always been my favourite sport. I enjoy the fast pace of the game, 
        the teamwork it requires, and the excitement of scoring a goal. 
        It keeps me active and helps me build strong connections with my teammates. 
        I have met so many cool people while playing hockey. 
        I have one friend from Latvia and another from Russia. I know people almost everywhere 
        I go because of hockey. I have also learned many life skills and leadership skills that 
        I use every day. Hockey has taught me many life lessons, and it has also helped me grow and 
        mature quickly. I am very grateful for everything that hockey has given me.

    <h2>My Favorite Team</h2>
    <p>
        My favourite team is the Edmonton Oilers. 
        Iâ€™ve followed them for years and always enjoy watching their games. 
        I have been an Oilers fan since day one. My first memory of them was when I was five, 
        my dad pulled me out of bed because my favourite player, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, was having a 
        really good game. We watched the rest of that game together. Nugent-Hopkins had a hat-trick and 
        the Oilers won. My absolute favourite memory was the first playoff game I went to. 
        It was round two, and the Oilers were playing the Anaheim Ducks. The Oilers won 7-2, 
        and the building was unreal. It was so loud, everyone in the rink was chanting, "Let's Go Oilers."
        That was one of the coolest experiences of my life. You can check out their official website
